Visual Design Brief

Inspiration: Basecamp (37signals)
Core Philosophy: Make progress feel calm, obvious, and human.

⸻

1. Design Principles

1.1 Calm Over Urgent
	•	Avoid aggressive colors (no bright reds, no flashing states)
	•	No “gamification pressure” (streaks, fireworks, badges)
	•	UI should feel like a quiet desk, not a control room

1.2 Opinionated Simplicity
	•	Fewer choices, clearer defaults
	•	Strong hierarchy so users rarely ask: “What should I do next?”
	•	One primary action per screen

1.3 Human, Not Mechanical
	•	Friendly copy
	•	Soft shapes
	•	Subtle imperfections (rounded edges, gentle shadows)

⸻

2. Visual Identity

2.1 Color Palette

Primary
	•	Warm off-white background (#FAFAF7 – #F6F6F3)
	•	Dark charcoal text (#2B2B2B)

Accent
	•	Muted blue (progress / links)
	•	Soft green (completed tasks)
	•	Pale yellow (notes / highlights)

Rules
	•	No pure black or pure white
	•	No saturated neon colors
	•	Status colors must be informational, not emotional

⸻

2.2 Typography

Primary Font
	•	Humanist or friendly sans-serif
	•	Examples: Inter, Source Sans 3, or system font stack

Usage
	•	Large, readable headings
	•	Generous line height
	•	Minimal font weight variation (Regular, Medium only)

Tone
	•	Feels like reading a letter, not a dashboard

⸻

3. Layout & Spacing

3.1 Layout Structure
	•	Single-column first
	•	Avoid dense grids
	•	Content flows top → bottom naturally

Navigation
	•	Shallow navigation (max 2 levels deep)
	•	Clear “home” that shows:
	•	What’s happening today
	•	What needs attention soon

⸻

3.2 White Space
	•	White space is a feature, not waste
	•	Every element must have room to breathe
	•	Avoid “boxed-in” UI

⸻

4. Task Representation

4.1 Task Cards
	•	Simple list items, not heavy cards
	•	Checkbox + task title
	•	Optional secondary text (due date / note)

States
	•	Default: neutral
	•	Completed: soft green text, subtle strikethrough
	•	Overdue: gentle color shift (never red alarm)

⸻

4.2 Task Grouping
	•	Group by context, not complexity:
	•	Today
	•	This Week
	•	Later
	•	Avoid tags overload

⸻

5. Interaction Design

5.1 Feedback
	•	Instant but subtle
	•	Small animations (150–200ms)
	•	No bouncing or elastic effects

Examples:
	•	Checkbox fills smoothly
	•	Task slides slightly when completed
	•	Fade-in for new tasks

⸻

5.2 Empty States
	•	Friendly, reassuring copy
	•	Example:
“Nothing to do here yet. That’s a good place to be.”

⸻

6. Copy & Microcopy

6.1 Tone of Voice
	•	Calm
	•	Encouraging
	•	Slightly conversational

Avoid
	•	“URGENT”
	•	“YOU MISSED THIS”
	•	“ACT NOW”

Prefer
	•	“When you’re ready”
	•	“Up next”
	•	“Take a look”

⸻

7. Icons & Visual Elements

7.1 Icons
	•	Simple, line-based
	•	Slightly rounded corners
	•	Consistent stroke width

7.2 Illustrations (Optional)
	•	Minimal, hand-drawn style
	•	Used sparingly (onboarding, empty states)
	•	Should feel supportive, not decorative

⸻

8. Accessibility & Comfort
	•	High contrast without harshness
	•	Large tap targets
	•	Keyboard-first interactions
	•	Dark mode:
	•	Warm dark gray background
	•	Muted contrast (not pure black)

⸻

9. What This Design Is NOT
	•	❌ Not a productivity “command center”
	•	❌ Not real-time collaboration chaos
	•	❌ Not feature-rich for the sake of power users

This is a tool for steady work, not constant urgency.

⸻

10. Emotional Goal

When users open the app, they should feel:

“Okay. I know what to do next. I can handle this.”
